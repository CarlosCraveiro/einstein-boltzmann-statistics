## Banner/Poster
Available at [`main.pdf`](https://github.com/CarlosCraveiro/einstein-boltzmann-statistics/blob/main/main.pdf).

## Template Used

The template used, `poster.typ`, was sourced from the repository [typst-poster](https://github.com/pncnmnp/typst-poster/tree/master), with only minor adaptations.

## Compile the Presentation

Download the dependencies yourself, which primarily include `typst` and a PDF viewer.

Or use `nix` to manage the dependencies for you:
```bash
nix --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'
nix develop -c $SHELL
```
Then, compile with:
```bash
typst compile main.typ
```
You should now have a `main.pdf` to take a look!
